    <string name="bio">Hi, my name is J.
    \n\nI love chilling with friends.
    \n\nWe take alcohol and most times get baked.
    \nFun fact is that we are all out going people and hate bad energy.
    \n\nWe play party games like truth and dare a lot.
    \nBut this time, i want to switch things up
    \nBy introducing my friends to Peke J
    \n\nTwo of my friends will imitate the actions they see in the game, while i hold the phone to either skip or continue
    \n\nI\'ll total the points each couple get and at the end, losers run around naked and winners take 3 tequila shots.
    \nYou should ask mazakpe about this game on twitter @makpalyy, all questions will be answered.\n\n
